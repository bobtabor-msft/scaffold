[Summarize the problem]

Our goal was to build a simple software application that could accept input from the user and display information to the user.

[How the tech solved the problem]

Utilizing basic C# syntax, the dotnet CLI, the Console class in the .NET Base Class Library and several developer tools already installed into the Azure Cloud Shell, we were able to ask the user to enter their name, store it in a variable and combine it with literal string data to display a new message.

[Business impact]

While our application may seem mundane as modern games go, most applications will perform these same basic features, including:
Displaying output to a user
Requesting input from a user
Processing information -- combining it, formatting it, calculating it, etc.

And so you’ve just taken your first steps to building more sophisticated applications that can retrieve input from a variety of sources, display it back to the user in a more graphical means or in a more structured way, and performing logic to enforce business or game rules.
